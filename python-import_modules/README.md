## Background Context

This project focuses on understanding Python modules and imports, essential for organizing and reusing code effectively. You will learn how to import functions from other files, create your own modules, use the `dir()` function to explore module contents, prevent script execution on import, and utilize command-line arguments with Python programs.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Modules](https://example.com)
- [Command line arguments](https://example.com)
- [Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://example.com)

These resources provide comprehensive coverage on Python modules, importing, command line arguments, and coding style guidelines. It's recommended to go through these materials to grasp the concepts thoroughly.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.10.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

More Info

Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings

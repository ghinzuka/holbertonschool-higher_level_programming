## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

- Python programming

## Author’s disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Python has a linter / style guide, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!

These resources provide foundational knowledge and practical tips for learning Python programming and adhering to coding standards.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## More Info

- **Pycodestyle:** Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code

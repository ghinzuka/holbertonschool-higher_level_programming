Your score will be updated as you progress.

## Background Context

This project focuses on understanding and applying Python's set and dictionary data structures. You will learn when to use sets versus lists, explore common set methods, understand dictionaries and their usage compared to other data structures, and grasp the basics of lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Data structures](https://example.com)
- [Lambda, filter, reduce and map](https://example.com)
- `man` or `help`:
  - python3

The above resources provide comprehensive coverage on Python data structures and functional programming concepts. It's recommended to go through these materials to grasp the concepts thoroughly.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

More Info
Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings

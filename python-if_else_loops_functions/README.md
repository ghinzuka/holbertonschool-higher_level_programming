## Resources

Read or watch:

- [More Control Flow Tools](https://example.com) (Read until “4.6. Defining Functions” included)
- [IndentationError](https://example.com)
- [How To Use String Formatters in Python 3](https://example.com)
- [Learn to Program 2 : Looping](https://example.com)
- [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://example.com)

Man or help:

- `python3`

These resources provide comprehensive coverage on control flow tools, indentation, string formatting, looping, and coding style guidelines. It's recommended to go through these materials to grasp the concepts thoroughly.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How to use the `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does, and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- What a function is and how to use functions
- What a function returns if it does not use any return statement
- Scope of variables
- What a traceback is
- What the arithmetic operators are and how to use them

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

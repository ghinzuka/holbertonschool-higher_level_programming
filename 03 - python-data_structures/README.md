## Background Context

This project focuses on understanding and applying Python's fundamental data structures: lists and tuples. You will explore their usage, methods, similarities and differences between strings, list comprehensions, and how to effectively utilize lists as stacks and queues. Additionally, the project covers tuples, sequence concepts, tuple packing, sequence unpacking, and the `del` statement.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [3.1.3. Lists](https://example.com)
- [Data structures (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)](https://example.com)
- [Learn to Program 6 : Lists](https://example.com)

The above resources provide comprehensive coverage on Python lists, tuples, and sequences. It's recommended to go through these materials to grasp the concepts thoroughly.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Most common methods of lists and how to use them
- Using lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions and their usage
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- Tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- How to use the `del` statement

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

More Info

Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings
